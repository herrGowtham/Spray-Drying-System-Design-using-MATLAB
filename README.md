This project was done as part of the course 'Computational Multiphase Flows" in the faculty of Applied Sciences at TU Delft. It deals with conceptualizing and designing a spray dryer, typically used in industries for milk powder drying. It involved a simplified analysis of the flow physics, heat and mass transfer mechanisms involved in the drying process. The objective was to obtain a uniform size and temperature distribution for the particles at the end of the drying process. Based on these, an approximate range for the dryer length, inlet air velocity and inlet particle temperature was recommended. All the analysis was done using MATLAB.
